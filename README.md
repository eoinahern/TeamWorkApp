# TeamWorkApp
demo project. to check out teamwork's open api


# first of all. Iam attempting to utilize teamwork's api. (https://www.teamwork.com/) which you can check out at the url. 
They basically provide a tool for project and task management. which is what i will be focusing on building the client app in android.

# the client is going to attempt to use Domain Driven design from the start. Initially ill build some core funtionality to do with updating projects
and tasks and projects etc. But I wont implement all functionality available through the api e.g. messaging. Ill be consuming json data and
for the most part the app will only deal with live data. I may look at push notigications at a later date and implement some form of caching.

# Android libs used will be retrofit, dagger 2 DI and RXjava and RXAndroid. I will also provide a suite of unit tests for the various layers
and will add some UI Tests for the Presentation layer.
